Pygame 1.9.0 partially builds with Python 3.x. setup.py installs Pygame 
without any special preparations. However not all modules will be 
included. All SDL only extension modules are available. And some of the 
optional modules are as well.


If this is an SVN checkout then the state of each source file can be 
checked with the python3 property. Its value is a comma separated list 
of tags:

	compiles - A C or Python file that will compile without errors, 
	but may not work correctly with Python 3.

	passes - This module compiles and passes the unit tests for 
	Python 3.

	runs - A module or program that compiles and runs without known 
	problems, but has no related unit tests for validation.

	partial_file - This module has a partial solution for Python 3 
	file support. Python 3.x replaces the PyFile_Type extension type 
	with an abstract interface and specific implementation types. 
	Unfortunately it doesn't make any of this directly available 
	with a C level api. So for now disk file objects are just 
	treated as another file-like object. This applies to extension 
	modules that pass open files to SDL in Python 2.x.

	partial_unicode - This module has a partial solution to unicode 
	support. This can apply to file names and stream content. For 
	Python 3 untested assumptions are made as to which encodings to 
	use. They may be wrong.

	released - This module is considered fully Python 3 compatible. 
	It passes its unit tests and has been used in the wild for 
	awhile. There are no outstanding Python 3 specific bugs.


On Windows Pygame uses the same dependencies for Python 3.x as Python 
2.6.
